# Pattern-Mining-Ethical-Concerns

Uncovering Patterns  in End-Users' Ethical Concerns about Software


Our approach uncovers contextual patterns in identified ethical concerns. Follow the jupyter notebooks in the following order. It consists of four main steps:
1. Preprocessing 
	1.1. Data_Preprocessing.ipynb

2. Classification of ethical concerns 
	2.1. Binary_Classification.ipynb
	2.2. Multi_Class_Classification_Random_Forest_Model.ipynb

3. Frequent pattern mining
	3.1.Frequent_Itemset_Generation_Algorithms.ipynb
	3.2. Frequent_Pattern_Mining.ipynb

4. Network graph visualization
	4.1. Network.ipynb
